#Generates the first n numbers in the following sequence:; 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20, 37, ___, ___, ___, â€¦

# 1. Ask user for int number for the length of the sequense.
# 2. Generate a sequense that takes the sum of the first 3 numbers in sequens to create the next number.
# 3. Only take the sum of the 3 numbers before the number to be generated to generate a new number.
# 4. Once you have generated the amount of numbers the user wanted print the sequense.
